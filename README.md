# Shpred (API)

This is the API for [shp.red](https://shp.red), built with Rails 5 and using various AWS services (S3, Elastic Transcoder, Cloudfront).  
It provides [Shpred frontend](https://github.com/MythicalFish/shpred-front) with image & video content, and for now is also the admin interface which allows you to manage the videos (this will be shifted over to the frontend when I have the time).
